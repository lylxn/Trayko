# 🎉 Trayko — Discover the Web, Collect Badges Effortlessly

Trayko is a lightweight browser extension that transforms everyday browsing into a playful adventure. Unlock badges by stumbling upon hidden internet easter eggs, track your progress in real time, and enjoy a clean, distraction‑free interface.

---

## 📋 Overview
Trayko runs silently in the background, detecting supported pages and events. When you trigger an easter egg, Trayko instantly updates your badge collection. The goal: make exploring the web rewarding, fast, and fun — without slowing you down.

---

## 🛠️ How I Built This
Trayko was designed with simplicity and performance in mind:

- **Background Script** → Handles event detection and badge unlocking logic.  
- **Popup UI** → Built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript for a clean badge viewer.  
- **Manifest v3** → Ensures compatibility with modern browsers and extension APIs.  
- **Badge System** → JSON‑structured badge definitions, dynamically updated when events are triggered.  
- **Real‑Time Updates** → Uses Chrome’s messaging API to sync background events with the popup interface instantly.  

Development workflow:
1. **Prototype** → Started with a minimal manifest + background script to detect page visits.  
2. **Badge Logic** → Added condition checks for easter egg triggers.  
3. **UI Design** → Built a popup with responsive layout and badge grid.  
4. **Optimization** → Minimized resource usage so Trayko runs quietly without slowing browsing.
